# MOFA: Multi-Omics Factor Analysis

MOFA is a factor analysis model that integrates multi-omic data sets in an unsupervised fashion. It automatically discovers the main sources of both technical and biological variability and it identifies whether they are unique or shared between several -omic layers. The model allows for the presence of missing values, including absence of entire assays for a given samples. Also, we provide an accessible and user-friendly package for a semi-automated annotation of factors.

We believe that MOFA has the potential to become a standard tool for simultaneous exploration of high-dimensional multi-omic data.
